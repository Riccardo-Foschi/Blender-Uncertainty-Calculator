Blender plugin for uncertainty assessment of hypotetical 3D reconstruction of lost or never built architecture

[Download the plugin from here!](https://github.com/rikkarlo/Blender-Uncertainty-Calculator/releases/download/v2.3.1/AU_VR.py)


How to install: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install from Disk -> Browse to the "AU_VR.py" python script downloaded from the link above -> the plugin will appear on the sidebar in the newly created "Uncertainty" tab.

Use the following image as an aid to assign the correct Uncertainty Level:

This is an example of false colour view for the dissemination of the uncertainty of an hypotetical 3D reconstruction:

Refer to the following table for the full description of each Level of Uncertainty (Remember that each level description is also accessible directly from the plugin by hovering the mouse on each button):

The mathematical formulas used to calculate the AU_V and AU_VR are reported below:

It is important to note that higher uncertainty in hypothetical reconstructions does not imply lower scientific value; well-documented high-uncertainty models can enhance understanding by critically integrating diverse sources and advancing scientific discourse. Nevertheless since the two formulas AU_V and AU_VR represents the extreme synthetis of the complex process of Uncertainty assessing, they have not to be considered self sufficient, but complementary to a proper documentation of the reconstruction process and visualization:
